## usage

## todos
### orbit - todos
- ipfs pin uploaded media
- (auto) pin project on ipfs - orbit-pinning service
    - https://github.com/orbitdb/field-manual/issues/83
- Bug: if device is offline - ipfs cannot connect to webrtc star - must work without internet too
    - e.g. remove addresses from swarm programmatically 
    - other possibilities? e.g. tell ipfs to not connect to swarm if not available or work without swarm.
    - ipfs node connects to some strange nodes e.g. wss://node2.preload.ipfs.io/p2p/QmV7gnbW5VTcJ3oyM2Xk1rdFBJ3kTkvxc87UFGsun29STS where is this coming from?
- show currently connected peers

#### ui - todos
- create component which lists posts of a certain tag
- add comments (make writeable to everybody)
- display author (identity) next to post (simply id)
- when deleting a post ask user before action
- change/edit post date
- responsive mobile navigation chakra-ui (e.g. about page displaying a certain post)
- store profile data in orbit-db (bio, seo, profile pic)
- store profile information under id

## nice to haves
- dns website - fallback html website hinterlegen als default und nur auf anforderung auf pure ipfs umschalten.

#### difficulties & discoveries
1. another user reported his Windows defender firewall was blocking the website.
2. some isp's seem to restrict p2p connections.
3. running vpn connections seem to disturb connecting via peer2peer
