## todos
### orbit - todos
- get db address from url - needs to be tested (current url + address + / + dbHash + / + dbName)
- Bug: if device is offline - ipfs cannot connect to webrtc star - must work without internet too
    - e.g. remove addresses from swarm programmatically 
    - other possibilities? e.g. tell ipfs to not connect to swarm if not available or work without swarm.
    - ipfs node connects to some strange nodes e.g. wss://node2.preload.ipfs.io/p2p/QmV7gnbW5VTcJ3oyM2Xk1rdFBJ3kTkvxc87UFGsun29STS where is this coming from?
- show currently connected peers

## nice to haves
- (auto) pin project on ipfs - orbit-pinning service
    - https://github.com/orbitdb/field-manual/issues/83
- dns website - fallback html website hinterlegen als default und nur auf anforderung auf pure ipfs umschalten.

#### ui - todos
- display author (identity) next to post 
- upload photos to post via ipfs
- add comments (make writeable to everybody)
- change/edit post date
- add tags to blog post
- when deleting a post ask user before action
- create component which lists posts of a certain tag 
- responsive mobile navigation chakra-ui (e.g. about page displaying a certain post)
- store profile data in orbit-db (bio, seo, profile pic)

#### difficulties
1. another user reported his Windows defender firewall was blocking the website.
2. some isp's seem to restrict p2p connections.
